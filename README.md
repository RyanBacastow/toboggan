# Toboggan
Toboggan is a simple command line tool using terraform, python, and several libraries to simplify the data migration process to snowflake by helping to automate:

- User and Role Creation
- Database and Compute Warehouse Creation
- Schema Migration
- Existing Codebase Migration

##### Inputs
- schemas.json
- users.json
- sql.json
- roles.json
- or simply use the prompts to manually enter information.

##### Data is useless. 
Data only has value when analytics users actually have the ability to use it to derive actionable business insights. And yet, the last 10 years have been characterized by enterprises embarking on giant data capture and storage projects only to struggle to capitalize on and effectively derive insights from this data.  Whats more, the infrastructure to capture, store, curate, organize, and support all this data capture can become a massive cost sink to the business. This has resulted in a seemingly endless cycle of long, costly and hard to maintain data migration projects trying to attain sustainable but ultimately unattainable value from larger and larger data lakes and databases. Many times custom solutions end up as cobbled together messes that are not accessible to the end user, scalable, or performant. To solve this issue SaaS companies like Oracle, Teradata, and others have offered managed solutions that help enterprise streamline and simplify their data warehousing practice at a great infrastructure cost with a vendor lock-in business model. This too has led to new problems such as data siloing, poor scaling, and tense vendor relationships. Analytics users, developers, and management find themselves frustrated by cost, time to value, and the labor required just to maintain these infrastructures. Unfortunately, many of theses stakeholders have a sense that there isnâ€™t anything they can do based on the past decisions, labor, and investments that have been made.

##### Technology is changing
The good news is that new technology is opening doors to cheaper, more sustainable, easier to manage, and accessible SaaS toolkits. With the advent of User first design + serverless programming paradigms offer more value at a fraction of the cost to legacy systems relying on always on relational models. Moving to a server-less database can cut costs substantially. More value, less cost: technology and new SaaS approaches. More-so than any other company, Snowflake represents this new wave of user friendly technology with innovative pricing solutions. However, because businesses are mired in their current infrastructure, they may not have the wherewithal or resources to create and allocate time and money to building replacement architecture taking advantage of these new tools.
